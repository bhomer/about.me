				<h1>Benjamin Homer</h1>
				<h2>SEO & Web Developer</h2>
					<p>I just celebrated my one year anniversary and have a baby on the way. I love playing sports, exercising, and being outdoors. When I have down time I also love to read about the latest technology trends and occasionally a novel. I graduated from UVU in Communications and Business and am currently working at the More Good Foundation as their SEO lead.
